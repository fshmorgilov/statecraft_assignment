# Assessment presentation for the position of Product manager - Statecraft.tech

*by Fedor Shmorgilov*

---

# Industry trends

 - Massive internet adoption in last 30 years provokes demand for transparency
 - Composable governance stacks are rising (e.g. Aragon OSx, Zodiac, Moloch V3)
 - ZK Tools like MACI, zkVoting, and Semaphore are gaining interest
 - Governance systems without privacy are seen as intransparent or outdated
 - Groups need robust, formal governance tools ‚Äî not just voting widgets ‚Äî inspired by Balaji's vision
 - Governance fatigue in web3 communities is real - that increases demand for Product-led governance

---

# Potential User Base

- **Non-Profit Organizations**: Transparent and accountable governance structures for collaborative decision-making
- **Government Structures**: Civic engagement platforms with secure, verifiable voting and adaptable governance modules
- **Web3 Communities & DAOs**: Especially those requiring complex structure and customizable frameworks but lacking technical resources
- **Universities & Research Institutes**: To manage funding, research projects, or decentralized academic governance
- **Online Movements & Advocacy Networks**: To run consensus-driven campaigns or delegate representation

---

# Problems to be Solved

- Most DAO tools lack flexibility beyond basic token voting and a single voting mechanism
- Most DAO constructors does not support complex org stracture entangled with other DAOs
- Existing off-chain platforms don‚Äôt support private, verifiable ballots
- No simple way to create checks and balances within DAOs
- DAO builders struggle to evolve governance beyond MVPs

---

# Solutions

- Governance-as-a-Service for both on-chain and off-chain communities
- Drag-and-drop model editor for flexible institution design
- Verifiable, private voting on public blockchains
- Use cases span DAOs, online communities, and civic projects
- Designed to support experimentation and legitimacy in Web3 governance

# Monetization Strategy

- **Token Sales**: Introduce a native utility token for accessing advanced governance modules, staking, and optional DAO participation incentives
- **B2B/G Sales**: Offer governance-as-a-service packages for protocol teams, platforms, and institutions needing structured digital governance tools
- **Paid Promotion**: Allow curated communities or DAOs to promote their governance spaces, proposal campaigns, or network-state initiatives


---

# SWOT Analysis 1/2

**Strengths**

- Modular, intuitive UI
- Private and verifiable voting
- Multi-role, customizable institutions
- Great technical engine that enables customization and repackaging to suit specific industry needs

**Weaknesses**

- Early adoption curve is steep
- Absence of integration with existing web3 ecosystem
- Complexity for non-technical users

---

# SWOT Analysis 2/2

**Opportunities**

- Rise of Network State discourse
- Technologies for building interconnected DAO structures like Aragon OSx are still in early stages so it is easier to obtain the large portion of the market segment.
- Regulatory-compliant DAO tooling demand

**Threats**

- Competing DAO frameworks
- Web3 adoption by general public¬†remains low
- Legal ambiguity in global jurisdictions

---

# Risk Mitigation Strategy

- Provide similar functions that existing DAO provides but with simplified UX
- Integrate into existing web3 ecosystem and adopt emerging technologies
- Smart contract audits before releases
- Governance modules tested in isolated deployments
- Advisory board across legal, civic tech, and protocol sectors

---

# Distribution Strategy

- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborate with DAO infrastructure providers, L2 networks, and civic tech platforms to expand reach and credibility
- **Content-Led Growth**: Offer educational resources such as guides, tutorials, webinars, and simulations targeted at DAO builders and community leaders
- **Product-led Growth**: Free-to-use governance templates and sandbox environments, viral loops through publicly visible governance setups
- **Ambassador Program**: Mobilize early adopters and power users to promote adoption across global DAO ecosystems

---

# Hypotheses part 1/2

Large-scale

- Offer preset templates that matches standard defi protocol to compete with existing DAO creation tools.
